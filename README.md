# TypeScript Mastery

Welcome to TypeScript Mastery! This repository is designed to help you master TypeScript. Each topic is covered with code examples.

## Table of Contents

1. [Implicit Type (Type Inference)](#implicit-type-type-inference)
   - Understand how TypeScript infers types without explicit declarations.

2. [Explicit Type (Defining Types)](#explicit-type-defining-types)
   - Learn to explicitly define types for variables, functions, and objects.

3. [Interfaces](#interfaces)
   - Define contracts for object shapes to enhance code maintainability.

4. [Types](#types)
   - Create custom named types for improved readability and flexibility.

5. [Union/Optional Types](#unionoptional-types)
   - Combine types with union types and define optional properties.

6. [Functions](#functions)
   - Explore function types, parameters, and arrow functions.

7. [Named Types](#named-types)
   - Give names to complex types for better code organization.

8. [Function Overloading](#function-overloading)
   - Provide multiple function signatures for a single function.

9. [Generics](#generics)
   - Write flexible and reusable components using generics.

10. [Enums and "as const"](#enums-and-as-const)
    - Define sets of named constants and use "as const" for literal types.

11. [keyof and typeof](#keyof-and-typeof)
    - Utilize `keyof` and `typeof` to create generic functions and enforce type safety.

12. [Utility Types](#utility-types)
    - Explore built-in utility types to manipulate and transform existing types.

13. [any, unknown, never, void](#any-unknown-never-void)
    - Understand TypeScript's special types for handling various scenarios.
